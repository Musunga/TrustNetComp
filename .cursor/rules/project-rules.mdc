# Project Rules

Rules in this folder (`.cursor/rules/`) are read by Cursor and applied when working in this project.

## Adding rules

- **Always apply**: Use a `.mdc` file with `alwaysApply: true` in the frontmatter so the rule is used in every conversation.
- **File-specific**: Use `globs: "**/*.ts"` (or other patterns) and `alwaysApply: false` so the rule applies only when matching files are relevant.
- Keep each rule under ~50 lines and focused on one concern.

## Example rule structure

```markdown
---
description: What this rule enforces
globs: "**/*.ts"   # optional; omit for always-apply
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule title

Add or edit `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` to define rules you want followed.
